# soundtracker

this is an old chiptune composition tool that I made as my first program back in 2014 (excluding the tutorials).

this tool emulates/implements a fictitious soundchip that I thought of years ago, with heavy inspiration from the 8-bit era soundchips (like the SID).

# and what is this "ssinter" thing?

ssinter is an interpreter for the soundchip dump format. check [ssformat.md](papers/ssformat.md) for more information.

# notes

this project uses blip-buf, which is under the same license.
